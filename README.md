# StringStretchJS
A short JavaScript program that 'stretches' a string. 
How it works:
1. A user enters a string
2. Program then prompts user to enter a number of integers equal to the lenght of that string
3. The program then duplicates each character in the string depending on its corresponding integer

For example:
If the user's input was 'welcome', the program would prompt the user to enter 7 integers (the lenght of the string). If the integers inputted were '2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 6', then the program would output 'wweeeeelllcoommmeeeeee'.
